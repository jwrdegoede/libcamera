List the TODOs in perceived order of ease.

Version 3:
Use dma-buf handle to generate upload texture:
	- eglCreateImageKHR can be used to generate the upload texture i.e.
	  to feed the bayer data into the GPU.

Denoising:
	- As below still TBD

Dead pixel correction:
	- As below still TBD

Lense shading correction:
	- This is WIP but as yet still TBD

Lense flare correction:
	- Not WIP still TBD

processFrame() to run in its own thread:
	- processFrame() runs in the context of the Debayer::process()
	  thread. Robert Mader suggested and it seems like a good
	  suggestion too to run processFrame() in its own thread.

Version 2:
Make GPUISP default:
	- Right now the environment variable allows over-riding to swtich
	  from CPU to GPU.
	- Once we support 24 BPP output on GPUISP we will have the same
	  pixel format support as CPU and can set the default to GPU without
	  regressing functionality

glTexture1D:
	- Initial code was developed for < GLES 2.O but since we have fixed
	  on GLES >= 2.0 this means we can use glTexture1D
	- Provided this is so amend the shaders to do val = texture(x, y, 0);
	  not texture(x, y, 0.5) the 0.5 is because of using glTexture2D

Denoising:
	- Run a denoise algorithm in the shaders
	- Supply a control to influence the noise-floor ?

Dead pixel correction:
	- Add logic to correct dead pixels in the fragment shaders

Version 1:
24 bit output support:
	- Take the BPP we already capture and get a 24 bit GBM surface
	- Pass a compile-time parameter to the shaders to tell them to do
	  gl_FragColor = rgb not gl_FragColor = rgba
	- Version 2:
	  This is not possible.
	  gl_FragColor expects vec4 not vec3 on the output.
	  If you really want RGB888 run cpuisp.

Surfaceless GBM:
	- We get a GBM surface and then have to swap buffers
	  If we rework for surfaceless GBM and EGL then the swap buffer can
	  be dropped.
	- Version 2:
	  Complete GBM surface removed, memcpy() phase removed also

dma-buf texture upload:
	- Currently we pass the input buffer to glCreateTexture2D.
	  We should be able to make the upload of the input buffer go faster
	  by using eglCreateImageKHR and enumerated the dma-buf contents.
	- Version 2:
	  Complete sm8250 test platform shows 20x performance increase
	  with CCM.

Render-to-texture:
	- Right now we render to the GBM provided surface framebuffer
	  and then memcpy from that buffer to the target output buffer.
	  This necessitates flushing the cache on the target buffer in
	  addition to the memcpy().
	- Render-to-texture where we generate the target framebuffer
	  directly from a dma-buf handle will mitigate the memcpy() phase.
	- It should be the case then that the consumer of the output buffer
	  i.e. the thing that's not libcamera is responsible to flush the cache
	  if-and-only-if that user writes to the buffer.
	- We need to flush the cache on the buffer because we are memcpying() to it.
	- Version 2:
	  Done in version 2
